# Web Support Plan for flutter_rough

This document outlines the plan to add comprehensive web support to the flutter_rough library, enabling it to run efficiently in browsers with full functionality.

## Current Status

### ✅ What Already Works
- **Core drawing algorithms**: All mathematical calculations and path generation

**Research Areas**:
- [ ] Feasibility of WASM for path calculations
- [ ] Performance comparison: JS vs WASM
- [ ] Bundle size implications
- [ ] Browser support matrix

### 4.2 Web Workers Support
**Goal**: Offload heavy computations to background threads

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Identify CPU-intensive operations
- [ ] Design worker communication protocol
- [ ] Implement path generation in workers
- [ ] Fallback for browsers without worker support

### 4.3 Modern Web Platform Features
**Goal**: Leverage cutting-edge web APIs when available

**Features to Explore**:
- [ ] Canvas 2D context features (Path2D objects)
- [ ] CSS Paint API integration
- [ ] WebGL2 for advanced rendering
- [ ] Canvas context creation optimization

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
