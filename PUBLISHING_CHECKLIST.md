## Publication Steps

When ready to publish:

1. **Commit all changes** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release version 0.1.2"
   git tag v0.1.2
   git push origin master --tags
   ```

2. **Publish to pub.dev**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub publish
   ```

3. **Post-publication**:
   - [ ] Verify package appears correctly on pub.dev
   - [ ] Test installation in a new project
   - [ ] Create GitHub release with migration notes
   - [ ] Consider announcing the update (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)

## Testing the Published Package

After publication, test in a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create test_rough_flutter
cd test_rough_flutter
flutter pub add rough_flutter
```

Then verify the basic example works:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:rough_flutter/rough_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: CustomPaint(
        painter: RoughPainter(),
        size: Size.infinite,
      ),
    ),
  ));
}

class RoughPainter extends CustomPainter {
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    final generator = Generator(
      DrawConfig.build(roughness: 2),
      HachureFiller(),
    );
    
    final circle = generator.circle(
      size.width / 2, 
      size.height / 2, 
      100,
    );
    
    canvas.drawRough(
      circle,
      Paint()..color = Colors.blue,
      Paint()..color = Colors.red,
    );
  }
  
  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(covariant CustomPainter oldDelegate) => false;
}
```

## Support Plan

After publication:
1. Monitor GitHub issues for migration problems
2. Be prepared to publish 2.0.1 for any critical fixes
3. Update documentation based on user feedback
