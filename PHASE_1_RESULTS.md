### Path Operations
- **Path Creation**: All OpType operations (move, lineTo, curveTo) work perfectly
- **Path Rendering**: OpSetType handling (path, fillPath, fillSketch) functions correctly
- **Performance**: No noticeable lag during complex path operations

## 🎯 Browser Compatibility Expectations

Based on Flutter's web support and our testing:
- **Chrome/Chromium**: ✅ Full support (tested)
- **Firefox**: ✅ Expected full support (CanvasKit compatible)
- **Safari**: ✅ Expected full support (WebKit compatible)
- **Edge**: ✅ Expected full support (Chromium-based)

## 📱 Mobile Web Expectations

- **Touch Interactions**: Should work (Flutter handles touch events)
- **Performance**: Expected to be good (CanvasKit is mobile-optimized)
- **Responsive Design**: UI should adapt properly
- **Memory Usage**: Expected to be reasonable

## ⚡ WebAssembly Opportunity

Flutter suggested WASM compilation:
```
Wasm dry run succeeded. Consider building and testing your application with the `--wasm` flag.
```

**Recommendation**: Try `flutter build web --wasm` for potentially better performance.

## 📦 Bundle Size Analysis

### Current Bundle
- **Estimated Size**: ~2-3MB (typical for CanvasKit apps)
- **Optimization**: Tree-shaking working effectively
- **Trade-off**: Larger bundle for better Canvas performance

### Future Optimization Opportunities
